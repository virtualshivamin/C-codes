## How to Use

To run any of these programs, follow these simple steps:
1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/virtualshivamin/C-codes.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the folder containing the program you want to run.
3. Compile the C code using a C compiler, for example:
   ```
   gcc program-name.c -o program-name
   ```
4. Run the compiled program:
   ```
   ./program-name
   ```
